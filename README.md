Only Connect made to be like the game show.

Play other users quizzes or create an account to make your own.

The image clues must be an image url from google.

The music questions url must be a youtube url with the start time of the music video in seconds and how long you want it to play the song from that start point in seconds.

The rest of the quesuions are just plain text clues and answers, the missing vowels clue will be the category (cities, foods ect) then the answer will be the full answer, the game will handle removing the vowels.

Host option should be used on a second device or seperate browser (only for the hosts eyes). It allows the host to navigate all the questions and see the answers
